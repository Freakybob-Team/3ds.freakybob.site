    <h2>freakybob.site is a website that was created by 5quirrel and wish13yt. This all started from Wish mentioning a "freakybob" domain. Everyone was looking at domains until Squirrel found a domain on a domain website. The domain was "freakybob.site" for $4.00. Squirrel bought it almost instantly starting the well deserved birth of freakybob.site!</h2>

    <strong><h4>Some Questions we've heard from people</h4></strong>
    <p id="para5">We know this website is very confusing asf so I'ma answer some of the most common questions !!</p>

    <strong><p>What is the point of this website?</p></strong>
        <p>Listen, you do not know how many times we hear this. The point of this website is just refering to the meme Freakybob and just having random ah features in the website :3</p>
    <strong><p>Squirrel, Do you even know anything to put here?</p></strong>
    <p>No, I do not.</p>
    <strong><p>Why there is no JavaScript in the website like other ports?</p></strong>
    <p>This is because while the New 3DS systems support JavaScript, Old 3DS Systems do not. As a result, there is no JavaScript in order to keep compatibility between those systems.</p>
<!--I FEEL SO FREAKY JUST LIKE FREAKYBOB!!!-->
